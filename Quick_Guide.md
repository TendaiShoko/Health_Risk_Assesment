## Time Spent: 3.5 Hours

**For Assessment Reviewers**

---

##  What's Included

This submission contains a complete healthcare risk assessment system with:

 **Python Script** (`healthcare_risk_assessment.py`) - Production-ready code  
 **Jupyter Notebook** (`healthcare_risk_assessment.ipynb`) - Interactive presentation  
 **Analysis Results** (`risk_assessment_results.csv`) - Risk scores for 100 conversations  
 **Visualizations** (`risk_assessment_analysis.png`) - Comprehensive charts  
 **Documentation** (`README.md`) - Full technical documentation  

---

## ⚡ Quick Run Instructions

### Option 1: Run the Python Script
```bash
python healthcare_risk_assessment.py
```
This will:
- Analyze all 100 conversations
- Generate visualizations
- Create detailed reports
- Save results to CSV

### Option 2: Open the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook healthcare_risk_assessment.ipynb
```
Then run all cells for interactive analysis and presentation.

##  What This System Does

1. **HIV Risk Assessment** (0-100 scale)
   - Analyzes conversations for HIV acquisition risk factors
   - Based on SA NDOH HIV Testing Services Policy 2016
   - Categories: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

2. **Mental Health Risk Assessment** (0-100 scale)
   - Screens for depression, anxiety, and severe symptoms
   - Based on SA NDOH Mental Health Policy Framework 2023-2030
   - Categories: MINIMAL, MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE

3. **Treatment Recommendations**
   - Evidence-based plans aligned with SA NDOH guidelines
   - Urgency determination
   - Specific referral pathways
   - Integrated care for comorbidities

---

##  Key Results from Dataset

**100 Conversations Analyzed:**
- All conversations showed LOW HIV risk (average score: 7.61/100)
- All conversations showed MINIMAL mental health risk (average score: 3.0/100)
- This is expected as the dataset contains generic synthetic conversations

**System Capability Demonstrated:**
- The notebook includes HIGH-RISK demonstration cases
- Shows proper risk stratification and urgent recommendations
- Validates the system works correctly for severe scenarios

---

##  Key Features

 **Evidence-Based**: Grounded in SA NDOH clinical guidelines  
 **Comprehensive**: Dual assessment (HIV + Mental Health)  
 **Actionable**: Specific treatment recommendations  
 **Integrated**: Addresses comorbidity  
 **Professional**: Production-quality code and documentation

##  Interview Preparation

I'm ready to present:
1. **Algorithm methodology** and clinical rationale
2. **SA NDOH guidelines** integration
3. **System architecture** and scalability
4. **Future enhancements** (ML/NLP integration)
5. **Deployment considerations** (privacy, ethics, equity)
6. **Live demonstration** from the notebook
